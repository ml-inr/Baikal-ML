 DESCRITPION OF '02_05_PreciseSelection_NewH8Data_ResNet_Gamma2'
Precise separation task.
Since we have 5e5 muatm on test, we can measure val_Expos on Suppr=5e-5 with relative error ~10%.
That is try to train model with the best EonS metric.
Gamma=2 focal loss.
Small noise in data. Disbalance classes in data. Big net.
